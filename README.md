DrvHorn is a tool to detect reference counting bugs in Linux kernel drivers, based on a CHC verification framework [SeaHorn](https://github.com/seahorn/seahorn).

# Setup and Example Usage

Users can use DrvHorn via Docker image we provided.

```shell
docker pull joehattori/drvhorn
```

`./scripts/run-drvhorn.sh` is a handy script to run DrvHorn with Docker.
When refcount bugs are detected, `sat` is emitted at the end of the output, and `unsat` is emitted when no bugs are found.

For example,

```shell
./scripts/run-drvhorn.sh --file-operations=tpm_bios_measurements_ops
```

outputs `sat` at the last line, indicating a refcount bug is detected in `tpm_bios_measurements_ops`.
This bug was fixed in [this commit](https://github.com/torvalds/linux/commit/5d8e2971e817bb64225fc0b6327a78752f58a9aa).

On the other hand, for drivers that DrvHorn do not find any refcount bugs, such as `ged_driver`,

```shell
./scripts/run-drvhorn.sh --platform-driver=ged_driver
```

outputs `unsat` at the last line.

## Manual Setup

### Building the Docker Image

Users can also build this image from the Dockerfile we provided.
After downloading a simple LLVM bitcode of Linux kernel from [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1UfBD8rnrLpGEOew3ZuU9CYK2_a_BR2g4/view?usp=sharing) to `./simple_kernel.bc`.

```shell
docker build -t joehattori/drvhorn -f docker/drvhorn.Dockerfile .
```

will build the Docker image.

### Building Locally

If users want to build DrvHorn in their local environment, manually executing the commands in [docker/drvhorn.Dockerfile](docker/drvhorn.Dockerfile) should work.
Note that users need to download Z3 of a specific version.
More detailed instructions can be found in the [seahorn repository](https://github.com/seahorn/seahorn).

### Building Linux Kernel into LLVM bitcode

When users wish to analyze Linux kernel with a custom config, they need to build the Linux kernel into an LLVM bitcode file.
After configuring the kernel, users can either apply [this patch](https://github.com/joehattori/drvhorn/blob/main/patches/gen-llvm-bc.patch) to the Linux kernel repository and run `make LLVM=-14 BUILD_BC=1` to obtain the LLVM file.

# Evaluation

For lightweight evaluation, we provided a simple script to run DrvHorn on multiple drivers in `./scripts/eval.sh`.

```shell
./scripts/eval.sh
```

As described above, `sat` indicates that refcount bugs are detected, and `unsat` indicates no bugs are found.

For full evaluation on all platform drivers, download the LLVM bitcode file we provided [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1qIu_5Z9rING1phQ0vd7DC9VRv7B95F69/view?usp=sharing) and run:

```shell
./scripts/full-eval.sh --full-kernel-bc=path/to/full/kernel.bc
```

Users can also bulid the LLVM bitcode file by themselves by building the Linux kernel configured with `allyesconfig` into LLVM bitcode.
